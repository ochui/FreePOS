# ApplicationCache to Service Worker Migration

This document describes the migration from the deprecated ApplicationCache API to Service Workers.

## What Changed

### Before (ApplicationCache)
- Used `manifest="/wpos.appcache"` in HTML files
- Relied on browser's ApplicationCache for offline functionality
- Limited control over cache updates and management

### After (Service Worker)
- Uses modern Service Worker API with Cache API
- Programmatic cache control and management
- Better offline experience and update handling
- More reliable and flexible caching strategies

## Files Modified

1. **index.html** - Removed manifest attribute, added Service Worker manager
2. **kitchen/index.html** - Removed manifest attribute, added Service Worker manager
3. **assets/js/wpos/core.js** - Replaced ApplicationCache event handlers with Service Worker logic
4. **kitchen/kitchen.js** - Replaced ApplicationCache event handlers with Service Worker logic
5. **sw.js** - New Service Worker implementation
6. **assets/js/wpos/sw-manager.js** - Service Worker management utility
7. **wpos.appcache** - Deprecated with proper HTTP 410 response

## Technical Details

### Service Worker Features
- Intelligent caching of assets and resources
- Background cache updates
- Offline fallback support
- Cache version management
- Better error handling

### Cache Strategy
- Core assets (HTML files) are cached during Service Worker installation
- Asset files (JS, CSS, images) are cached on-demand with background updates
- API endpoints and dynamic content are excluded from caching
- Offline fallback to main page for navigation requests

### Browser Support
- Service Workers are supported in all modern browsers
- Graceful degradation for browsers without Service Worker support
- Fallback to normal operation if Service Worker registration fails

## Testing

The migration maintains the same user experience while providing more reliable offline functionality. Test the following scenarios:

1. **Fresh Installation**: Should cache core assets and work offline
2. **Updates**: Should detect updates and reload the application
3. **Offline Operation**: Should continue working when network is unavailable
4. **Cache Management**: Admin functions should be able to clear caches

## Backwards Compatibility

- Existing installations will automatically migrate to Service Workers
- No user action required for the transition
- Applications will continue to work even if Service Workers fail to register

## Future Improvements

The Service Worker implementation provides a foundation for additional features:
- Push notifications
- Background sync
- More sophisticated caching strategies
- Better offline data management
