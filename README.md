## âš¡ Built with Laravel

FreePOS has been reimplemented using the Laravel framework, providing:
- Modern PHP architecture

- Laravel's powerful routing and middleware
- Better security and authentication
- Improved maintainability and scalability

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. Configure your web server to serve from the `public/` directory
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your environment
3. Run migrations: `php artisan migrate`
4. Access different applications:
   - API: `/api/*`
   - Main POS: `/pos`
   - Admin: `/admin`


## Server Prerequisites

FreePOS requires:

   - cURL
   - GD
   - PDO
   - Mbstring
   - OpenSSL
   - Tokenizer
   - XML
   - JSON

2. **Composer** for dependency management

3. **MySQL/MariaDB** or other Laravel-supported database

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Laravel 12
- **Database**: MySQL/MariaDB with Eloquent ORM
- **Authentication**: Laravel Sanctum
- **Frontend**: Vue.js (preserved from original)
- **Real-time**: Socket.io / Pusher / Ably (optional)

## Legacy Compatibility

While the backend has been reimplemented in Laravel, the frontend applications and APIs maintain backward compatibility with the original FreePOS structure.
